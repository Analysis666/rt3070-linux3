This is the D-Link DWA-125 Wireless Adapter driver (rt3070 module) patched for Linux 3.x versions.
It's based on the official D-Link driver code v2.1.2.0 and I make an effort to maintain this driver
compiling with new kernel versions since official D-Link support has ended.

Latest Linux tested: 3.2.0

Use at your own risk. ;)
